ANALYSIS SUMMARY
 
PROJECT GOAL
Identify why profit varies widely across states and measure how discounting impacts margins.
 
KEY METRICS ANALYZED
 Sales  
 Profit  
 Discount %  
 Loss due to discount  
 YoY (Year-over-Year) performance  
 
 
CORE INSIGHTS
1. Profitability by State
Mapping analysis revealed strong profit in several states, while others experienced negative margins despite high sales volume.
 
2. Discount Loss
High discounting directly correlated with negative profit.  
Total loss due to discount exceeded $154K across all states.
 
3. YoY Performance
Some states showed revenue growth, while others declined significantly, indicating inconsistent strategy execution.
